### Message Passing

The Message Passing Module enables customers to raise support tickets via Amazon Lex and connects them to property agents using Google Cloud Pub/Sub. Firebase facilitates real-time chat for seamless, ticket-based customer-agent communication.

**Key components include:**

- **Google Cloud Pub/Sub**: Facilitates asynchronous messaging, allowing customers to publish booking-related concerns that are processed and assigned to random property agents.
- **Google Cloud Functions**: Subscribes to Pub/Sub topics, processes messages, and routes them to a randomly selected property agent.
- **Firebase Real-Time Database**: Creates and maintains a real-time chat between customers and assigned agents, enhancing responsiveness and customer support.

**Features:**

- **Asynchronous Messaging with Google Cloud Pub/Sub**:  Ensures efficient, decoupled communication by allowing customers to publish booking concerns based on reference codes, improving system responsiveness.

- **Agent Assignment via Google Cloud Functions**: Processes messages and dynamically assigns each inquiry to a random property agent, optimizing workload distribution.

- **Real-Time Customer-Agent Chat**: Utilizes Firebase Real-Time Database to create instant, live chat connections for active ticket resolutions, enhancing user support and engagement.

### Notifications

User notifications for registration, login, and booking confirmations are handled by AWS SNS and AWS SQS. The module sends real-time updates and manages internal application processes efficiently.

**Key components include:**

- **AWS SNS**: Sends email notifications to users upon successful registration, login, and booking status updates, ensuring timely communication.
- **AWS SQS**: Manages booking requests by queuing them for asynchronous processing, enabling efficient and decoupled handling of requests.
- **AWS Lambda**: Processes booking requests from the SQS queue, handling approvals and triggering SNS to notify users of booking confirmations or rejections.

**Features:**

- **Automated User Notifications with AWS SNS**: Delivers real-time updates to users on critical actions, such as registration, login, and booking confirmations or rejections.
- **Asynchronous Booking Request Management via AWS SQS**: Queues booking requests to reduce system dependencies and ensure reliable, decoupled processing.
- **Streamlined Approval Process with AWS Lambda**: Efficiently processes queued booking requests from SQS and triggers SNS notifications, providing users with timely updates and enhancing system efficiency.

### Web Application Building and Deployment

The front-end is built using React and hosted on Google Cloud Run. Deployment is automated using AWS CloudFormation and GCP Cloud Deployment Manager, ensuring a robust and scalable application infrastructure.

## Steps to Run

Follow these steps to set up and run the DalVacationHome project:

### 1. Upload Lambda Functions to S3

- **Navigate to your S3 bucket**: Choose or create an S3 bucket where the Lambda function zip files will be stored.
- **Upload Lambda ZIP files**: Upload all the Lambda function zip files to the `lambda/` directory within the S3 bucket.

    ```bash
    aws s3 cp path/to/auto-confirm-user-v1.zip s3://your-bucket-name/lambda/auto-confirm-user-v1.zip
    aws s3 cp path/to/user-login-email-password-v1.zip s3://your-bucket-name/lambda/user-login-email-password-v1.zip
    aws s3 cp path/to/user-registeration-v1.zip s3://your-bucket-name/lambda/user-registeration-v1.zip
    ```

- **Update Lambda Configuration in CloudFormation**: In the CloudFormation script (`/iac/DalVacationHome-CF.yaml`), update the `CodeUri` property for each Lambda function to point to the S3 keys of the uploaded zip files.

    ```yaml
    Resources:
      MyLambdaFunction:
        Type: 'AWS::Lambda::Function'
        Properties:
          Code:
            S3Bucket: your-bucket-name
            S3Key: s3Key
          ...
    ```

### 2. Create a Role with Necessary Permissions

- **Create the Role**: Create a new IAM Role or use an existing one with the necessary permissions (e.g., `LabRole`).

    ```bash
    aws iam create-role --role-name LabRole --assume-role-policy-document file://trust-policy.json
    ```

- **Attach Policies**: Attach the necessary policies to the Role to allow Lambda functions to execute.

    ```bash
    aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name LabRole --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole
    ```

- **Update Role ARN in CloudFormation**: In the CloudFormation script, update the `Role` property for each Lambda function to include the ARN of the created Role.

    ```yaml
    Resources:
      MyLambdaFunction:
        Type: 'AWS::Lambda::Function'
        Properties:
          Role: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/LabRole
          ...
    ```

### 3. Run the CloudFormation Script

- **Navigate to the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) directory**:

    ```bash
    cd /iac
    ```

- **Deploy the CloudFormation stack**: Use the AWS CLI to create or update the stack with the provided CloudFormation template.

    ```bash
    aws cloudformation deploy --template-file DalVacationHome-CF.yaml --stack-name DalVacationHomeStack
    ```

- **Monitor the Deployment**: Check the CloudFormation console to monitor the progress and ensure the stack is created successfully.

### 4. Deploy the Frontend application to CloudRun

- **Build a docker image and push it to the Google Artifact Registry**:

    ```bash
    docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t image .
    ```
    ```bash
    docker tag image us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/my-project-99692-428401/my-repo/image
    ```
    ```bash
    docker push us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/my-project-99692-428401/my-repo/image
    ```
- **Deploy the changes to Google CloudRun**:

    ```bash
    gcloud run deploy my-service \
  --image us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/my-project-99692-428401/my-repo/image2 \
  --platform managed \
  --region us-central1 \
  --allow-unauthenticated
    ```

### 5. Create a Firebase Project 

- **Create a default Firestore database.**
- **Create 2 functions - publishMessage and createChat.**
- **Generate WebApps Client for our frontend and get the keys**

### 6. Create a .env file

- **Create an .env file at `frontend/` and add the following keys**
  ```bash
  REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY={FIREBASE_API_KEY}
  REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN={FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN}
  REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID={FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID}
